## The background

Your challenge is to create a web application that helps you transfer money.

On the left side of the screen, you have a form to enter the recipient's details.
On the right side, you have the list of transactions you've made so far.

The user fills in the form with the recipient's details, name, email and the amount they'd like to transfer. When a field is not valid, an inline error message is displayed under the field.

Clicking the "Send" button will add a transaction if all the fields are valid and will display a temporary success message at the top.
