# React Coding Challenge - Zopa

Congratulations! You're here because you've made it through to the next step of your Zopa interview.

We'd like to ask you to complete this coding challenge, so you can showcase your creative problem-solving and technical ability.

We hope you'll enjoy it. It should take around **4 hours**, give or take.
We're happy to look at partial solutions too.

We're on the lookout for best practices and evidence that you understand the technology.
We insist that you use React as well as our React components library (https://github.com/zopaUK/react-components) to complete this challenge â€“ but you're free to use any other libraries or tools on top.

## The background

Your challenge is to create a web application that helps you transfer money.

On the left side of the screen, you have a form to enter the recipient's details.
On the right side, you have the list of transactions you've made so far.

The user fills in the form with the recipient's details, name, email and the amount they'd like to transfer. When a field is not valid, an inline error message is displayed under the field.

Clicking the "Send" button will add a transaction if all the fields are valid and will display a temporary success message at the top.

## Your task

- Build the screen so it follows the guidelines from the supplied design (available in the design folder)
- Implement the business logic as described above. If there's something you're not sure about, feel free to come up with your own solution.
- Provide tests for your code. Recommended tools: [jest](https://codesandbox.io/docs/tests) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)

Bonus points (optional, only if you have done everything and have time to spare):

- The application is designed for desktop. Use your creativity to make the design responsive, so it looks great on mobile devices as well.
- To make this challenge more realistic, you can submit the form data to a firebase database [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore) or any other suitable service, and list the transactions from the database.

## How to submit your web application

When you're happy with the result, send the link to your forked CodeSandbox project to your recruiter. We will only accept a CodeSandbox link.

We'd like you to also provide answers to those questions:

- What you liked and disliked about this test?
- Which tasks were easy for you and which ones were difficult?
- How long did it take you to complete it?
- Please give us any feedback about what you have done, what you weren't able to do and how it went in general.

To keep this coding challenge fair for all candidates, please don't publish your code to a publicly accessible Git repository.
